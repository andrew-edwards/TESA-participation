Hi,

Please see the attached document for details of the training courses, workshops
and free webinars
being put on by DFO's Technical Expertise in Stock Assessment (TESA) group for 2019-2020.

Note that the free webinar series on R tools may also be of interest to people
who do not work on assessments (a further advert will go out later - you do
not need to do anything now).

As usual, TESA subsidises travel for courses and workshops, but a portion of travel costs
needs to come from local budgets (usually 40-70% depending on the event).
The workshops are subsidised more than the
training courses. The expected numbers of participants listed in the document are for the whole country.

If you are interested in participating in a training course or workshop then:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary prerequisites.

2. Check you will have the travel funds required (if you don't know for sure
then still do step 3 so we have an idea of numberes).

3. Please fill out the short Google Form at https://forms.gle/me3XDB5nTh4cBtFL6

Ideally please fill out the form by Monday 17th June (apologies for the short notice), but
we will keep the form open longer (Wednesday 3rd July). Note there is often more interest
than the places available, and so be sure to explain (in the Google Form) how the event will be
relevant to your stock assessment work.

Thanks,

Brooke Davis and Andrew Edwards (Pacific TESA representatives)
