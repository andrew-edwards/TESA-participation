# TESA-participation
Code to summarise TESA participation from Google Forms results

Hadn't changed title of Google Form from 2017 to 2018 so it still saves as `Pacific TESA participation 2017-18.csv`. Just rename to `TESA18-19.csv` when unzip 
it.

For final Pacific participants, use `TESAfunds18.csv`, adapted from the spreadsheet, mainly 23 July 2018 which is the final. I will then do any updates in my .csv file, and let hosts know.
